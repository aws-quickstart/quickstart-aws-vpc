After you use this Quick Start to build your VPC environment, you can
deploy additional Quick Starts or deploy your own applications on top of
this AWS infrastructure. If you decide to extend your AWS environment
with https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[additional Quick Starts] for
trial or production use, we recommend that you choose the option to
deploy the Quick Start into an existing VPC, where that option is
available.

If you decide to deploy additional private subnets with dedicated
network ACLs, make sure you review the configuration and adjust it
accordingly. By default, the custom ACLs are configured to allow all
inbound and outbound traffic to flow in order to facilitate the
deployment of additional infrastructure. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html[Network
ACLs] and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_NACLs.html[Recommended
Network ACL Rules for Your VPC] in the Amazon VPC documentation.
