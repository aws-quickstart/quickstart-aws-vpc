You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running
this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for
using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes
configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of the settings,
such as the instance type, number of Availability Zones, use of NAT
gateways or NAT instances (depending on the AWS Region you choose), and
amount of data that flows through the NAT device, will determine the
cost of deployment. To get an estimate, you can use the
