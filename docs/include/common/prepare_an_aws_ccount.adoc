*Tip* Consider choosing a region closest to your data center or
corporate network to reduce network latency between systems running on
AWS and the systems and users on your corporate network.

Also, note that your choice of region will determine whether the Quick

a list of regions that support NAT gateways, see
http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/[Amazon VPC pricing].

Figure 3: Creating a key pair

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login
information. To be able to log in to your instances, you must create a
key pair. With Windows instances, we use the key pair to obtain the
administrator password via the Amazon EC2 console and then log in using
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as explained in the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[step-by-step
instructions] in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_. On
Linux, we use the key pair to authenticate SSH login.
