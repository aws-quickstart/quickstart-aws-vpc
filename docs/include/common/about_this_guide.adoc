This Quick Start reference deployment guide discusses architectural
considerations and configuration steps for deploying a modular Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment on the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Cloud. It also provides links for viewing and launching
http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation] templates that
automate the deployment.

The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, DevOps engineers, and
administrators who would like to build a flexible, modular AWS
networking infrastructure as a baseline for their deployments.

http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Quick Starts] are automated reference
deployments for AWS Cloud infrastructure components and key enterprise
workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches, configures, and
runs AWS compute, network, storage, and other services, using AWS best
practices for security and availability.
