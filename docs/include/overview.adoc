This Quick Start provides a networking foundation for AWS Cloud
infrastructures. It deploys an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
according to AWS best practices and guidelines. Amazon VPC is the
networking layer for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and
provides a private, isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can
launch AWS services and other resources in a virtual network. For a
discussion of best design practices for Amazon VPC environments, see the
documentation and articles listed in the
link:#additional-resources[Additional Resources] section.

The Amazon VPC architecture includes public and private subnets. The
first set of private subnets share the default network access control
list (ACL) from the Amazon VPC, and a second, optional set of private
subnets includes dedicated custom network ACLs per subnet. The Quick
Start divides the Amazon VPC address space in a predictable manner
across multiple Availability Zones, and deploys either NAT instances or
NAT gateways for outbound Internet access, depending on the AWS Region
you deploy the Quick Start in.

You can use this Quick Start as a building block for your own
deployments. You can scale it up or down by adding or removing subnets
and Availability Zones according to your needs, and add other
infrastructure components and software layers to complete your AWS
environment.
