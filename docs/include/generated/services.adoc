The core AWS components used by this Quick Start include the following
AWS services. (If you are new to AWS, see the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/intro.html[Getting
Started section] of the AWS documentation.)

* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/[Amazon VPC] – The Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service lets you provision a private,
isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS services and
other resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete
control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of
an IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route
tables and network gateways.
* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/[Amazon EC2] – The Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service enables you to launch virtual
machine instances with a variety of operating systems. You can choose
from existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) or import your own virtual
machine images.
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[Amazon
EBS] – Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent
block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS
Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its
Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high
availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes provide consistent and
low-latency performance to run your workloads.
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT
Gateway] – NAT gateways are network address translation (NAT) devices,
which provide outbound Internet access to instances in a private
subnets, but prevent the Internet from accessing those instances. NAT
gateways provide better availability and bandwidth than NAT instances.
The NAT Gateway service is a managed service that takes care of
administering NAT gateways for you. NAT gateways aren’t supported in all
AWS Regions. This Quick Start deploys NAT instances in regions where NAT
gateways aren’t available.
